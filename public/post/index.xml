      <description>Welcome back to our final installment of ggplot2 data visualization! Today, we are doing bar plots!
library(Lahman)library(sqldf)library(ggplot2)A bar plot lays out the different levels of an attribute or factor! We will look at the team homerun totals for all the MLB teams in 1980.
query&amp;lt;-&amp;quot;SELECT name,HR FROM Teams WHERE yearID=1980 ORDER BY HR &amp;quot;result&amp;lt;-sqldf(query)result$name&amp;lt;-factor(result$name,levels=result$name)The last line is saving the information as a factor, and letting the system know that the order the results appear in the order we specified, not default alphabetical.</description>

      <description>Hey y’all!
I am going to put the link to my github website about how to use SQL in here again for reference:
https://sjense67.github.io/Website/
And then I am going to add the link for another on of my github websites, which I am using to explore dashboards! Come see what I’m doing, and don’t forget that you can always email me or find me on social media to get in contact!</description>

      <description>Up next on the data visualization journey: Histograms!
Histograms what people often think of as bar graphs. They show the spread and shape of a single set of data. For our example, let’s look at the weights of MLB players through the Master table in the Lahman database. While some weights aren’t available, the program with automatically exclude those rows, which do not have a numerical value.
library(Lahman)library(sqldf)library(ggplot2)Here is the sql request:</description>

      <description>Hello again! This time we are going to look at data visualization in the form of time series!
A time series is similar to a scatterplot, in the way that it has two sets of data against each other. However, one of those sets of data is time. Let’s get started!
library(Lahman)library(sqldf)library(ggplot2)We will look at Babe Ruth’s homeruns over his twenty-two seasons. Here is the sql request:</description>

      <description>Here we go on our first adventure in data visualization. Let’s take the homeruns and strikeouts from the Lahman database of baseball statistics and make a scatterplot!
First, we need to load our libraries. This tells the computer what sets of data to look at!
library(Lahman)library(sqldf)library(ggplot2)Next, we are going to specify what we are looking for. In this case, career homeruns and strikeouts from players who had more than 400 homeruns.</description>

      <description>Hello!
Welcome to my blog about Dr. Redmond’s Intro to Data Science class at Mercyhurst University! This blog is being created for and utilized in the MIS 150 class. We will be going through some data visualization tools. We will be using R Studio, SQL, and ggplot primarily to do this. If you are unfamiliar with SQL, feel free to go check out my website of tutorials and examples at https://sjense67.</description>
